## How does Walless do?

### Simplify Onboarding

Walless, designed to simplify the onboarding process for new users. With **passwordless** login and **social authentication**, there's no need to remember a seed phrase or worry about losing access to your wallet. It is **self-custodial**, giving you full control over your digital assets at all times. Plus, our **automated wallet creation** process makes it easy to get started with just a few clicks. And with advanced security features, you can be confident that your digital assets will **remain secure**.

### Unified UI across network

Walless puts users in control. Walless unifies the user interface across different networks, **eliminating** the confusion that comes with **network switching**. By designing our wallet with a **focus on dApps, rather than individual networks**, we make it focusing on product. And with our customizable layout store, you can decide exactly how your wallet looks and what information you see. At Walless, we believe that users should have the power to **design their own wallet** and manage their assets their way.

### Open Sandbox for anyone

Welcome to our open sandbox - the perfect place for anyone looking to integrate their dApps into Walless. Our **runtime for embedded dApps** allows you to run games, marketplaces, chats, swaps, payment solutions, and more natively within the wallet itself. And with our **permissionless, community-driven dApps and layout store**, you can explore a wide range of users. Plus, we're committed to being **open source and open data**, with **accessible API** to make integration and development as easy as possible.
