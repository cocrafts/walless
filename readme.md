**World's first Web3 sandbox-wallet** with embedded dApps, simplified onboarding through social logins, and a unified cross-chain interface, offering a seamless experience for new web3 users. This allows for endless possibilities for building on Walless and enables even web2 apps to onboard to the world of web3.

## Required tools
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (for sure)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed globally (`npm i -g yarn`) — highly suggested `version 3.5` or later.
- [Metacraft CLI](https://github.com/cocrafts/metacraft-cli) installed globally (`npm i -g @metacraft/cli`)

## Required configs
- To actually run the project, different `.env` files need for different child Apps (under `apps/`). Right now, we did not have "public" env file for the crowd. We'll provide that in the near future, when security checks completed.
- As Walless welcome anyone want to contribute, you can join our discord (see it on [our home page](https://walless.io)), and ask for collaboration program to have early access to our open-collaboration pipeline.

## CLI commands
- Development: run `yarn dev` at project root (or `metacraft` under apps/home)
- Build: `yarn build` (or `metacraft bundle` under apps/[name])
- Extension build: under `apps/web` run `yarn build:ext` instead to produce zip files (output to `apps/landing/public/builds`)
- Package version check `yarn dlx lerna-update-wizard`
- Sync font for React Native: `yarn dlx react-native-asset`
